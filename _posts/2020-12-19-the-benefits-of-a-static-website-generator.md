summary: On many websites, every request to the server is handled by complex dynamic code. This slows things down. Often this level of complexity is not needed and can be avoided by generating static content.

Static sites work best if most of the pages:
- Have aÂ low degree of user interactivity
- Do not update frequently


This is typically:

- Blogs
- Informational sites
- Landing pages
- Selling pages
- Company pages
- Documentation
- Portfolio


# Some benefits of static sites
- **Performance.**  Static sites are fast. There is no server-side processing and no database to connect to, meaning that there is nothing to slow the process of getting a page from the server to your end user
- **Security.** Static sites are immune to the most common attacks, as they do not contain dynamic content: there are no server-side language issues to exploit and no database to hack
- **Content versioning.** Since your entire site, from configuration to content, is file-based, it is very easy to keep all aspects of it within a version control system like Git.
- **Previewable.** Because static sites are developed locally, you can play around with that local site without affecting the live site.
- **Hosting.** Since no server-side language is required, hosting doesn't require complicated setup or maintenance, making it cheap and easy. In fact, there are even free options, like GitHub pages.
